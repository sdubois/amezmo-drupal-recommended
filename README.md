# amezmo-drupal-recommended

This project is meant to be used as a starting point for creating new Drupal sites on the [Amezmo](https://www.amezmo.com) platform. This project essentially creates a standard Drupal 9 installation with a few custom additions necessary to run on Amezmo.

This project is inspired by pantheon-systems/drupal-recommended
